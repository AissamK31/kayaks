# Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```js
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

```js
let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3
```

solution

let triangle = "";
for (let result =0; result < 7; result++){
    console.log(triangle +="#");
};
